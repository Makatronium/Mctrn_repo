>>>Auto_Install<<<

Auto_Install.sh is a simple shell script that can be run on linux OS( I wrote it in Ubuntu 16.04).I mainly created this for new Ubuntu users who doesn't want to install essential softwares individually( Believe me it's really boring).Just open your Linux terminal and type the command "sudo ./Auto_Install.sh".You may need to change it permission to make it executible(It depends).
(Permission command example: chmod 755 Auto_Install.sh).

The following softwares will install after running this script: "VIM,VLC,Chrome,Sayonara,GIMP,Darktable,Dropbox,Kdenlive,Atom,SimpleNote,Hiri,Gscan2pdf"
